        <h1>Building Resilient Global Supply Chains with IoT: Low‑Power Connectivity and Intelligent Sensing</h1>
        <img src="article1.png" alt="Illustration of IoT-enabled global supply chain">

        <h2>Apple Ko’s Vision for Connected Logistics</h2>
        <p>As Vice President of Global Product Sales &amp; Business Development at EELink Communication Technology Co., Ltd., Apple Ko has witnessed firsthand how the <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong> is redefining asset management and supply‑chain efficiency. Today’s global logistics networks span continents, climates and regulatory environments. Achieving real‑time visibility across such complex systems requires low‑power devices that can collect environmental data, report location and operate autonomously for years. Her work focuses on bringing these technologies from concept to market so that businesses can transform how they move goods and manage inventory.</p>

        <h2>Why LTE‑M and NB‑IoT Matter</h2>
        <p>Long‑distance asset tracking used to involve trade‑offs: high costs, limited coverage or frequent battery replacements. Two cellular technologies—<strong>LTE‑M</strong> and <strong>NB‑IoT</strong>—are changing that paradigm by providing <strong>low‑power, wide‑area connectivity</strong>. They were developed under the 3GPP standard to allow simple devices to send small data packets over long distances while using minimal energy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>LTE‑M</strong> (Long Term Evolution for Machines) supports voice (VoLTE), real‑time mobility and up to 1.4&nbsp;MHz of bandwidth. It is ideal for assets in motion—trucks, rail cars and shipping containers—because devices stay connected as they cross cell towers at highway speeds.</li>
            <li><strong>NB‑IoT</strong> operates on a narrow 180&nbsp;kHz channel and uses even less power. It excels in stationary or slow‑moving situations such as warehouse pallets, reusable transport containers or cold‑storage units.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These technologies enable trackers with battery lifespans of <strong>up to 10&nbsp;years</strong>. By waking only to transmit data at defined intervals, devices conserve energy while still providing continuous monitoring.</p>

        <h3>Real‑World Deployments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Germany’s Deutsche Telekom</strong> uses NB‑IoT sensors to track reusable transport packaging, improving recovery rates for low‑value but frequently misplaced assets.</li>
            <li><strong>Roambee</strong> in the United States relies on LTE‑M to monitor pharmaceutical shipments; its devices collect not only location data but also temperature, humidity and light exposure—critical metrics for compliance and quality control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These examples demonstrate that LPWA technologies are not just proof‑of‑concept. They’re quietly streamlining supply chains today by making lower‑value items part of the data flow.</p>

        <h2>IoT as the Backbone of Modern Supply Chains</h2>
        <p>According to Gartner, half of large global companies will integrate AI, advanced analytics and IoT into their supply‑chain operations by 2025. IoT devices deliver transparency by letting companies locate goods, monitor storage conditions and predict arrival times. Key applications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Asset Tracking and Route Planning</strong> – Sensors replace barcodes and manual tracking with continuous location and status updates. Businesses can identify delays in transit and plan alternate routes to keep shipments on schedule.</li>
            <li><strong>Inventory Visibility</strong> – Real‑time monitoring of raw materials, work‑in‑progress and finished goods across facilities helps companies optimize warehouse space and capital. Predictive planning ensures the right stock is in the right place at the right time.</li>
            <li><strong>Returnable Asset Management</strong> – By tagging pallets, crates and shipping containers, businesses can recover missing assets and analyze patterns of theft or misuse.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Collecting time‑stamped data from sensors allows supply‑chain systems to evolve from static status reports to <strong>predictive intelligence</strong>. Deviations in route, temperature excursions or tampering events can trigger instant alerts, giving companies the ability to act before problems affect product quality.</p>

        <h2>EELink’s Comprehensive Portfolio</h2>
        <p>At EELink, we design devices that combine <strong>multi‑sensor capabilities</strong>, <strong>LPWA connectivity</strong> and <strong>industrial‑grade ruggedness</strong>. Our product family addresses a wide array of use cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>GPT50 Ultra‑Long GPS Tracker</strong> – Ultra‑long GPS (GPT50): 24 000 mAh, multi‑GNSS, LTE Cat‑1 (2G fallback). Up to 10‑year standby. ~350 g (±10 g), −20 °C to +60 °C, IPX7.</li>
            <li><strong>GPT29 Smart Monitoring Device</strong> – Combines temperature, humidity, shock and light sensors with LTE‑Cat M1/NB‑IoT connectivity. Its one‑year rechargeable battery is perfect for cold‑chain logistics and pharmaceutical shipments.</li>
            <li><strong>DB01 BLE Sensor Beacon</strong> – A compact USB‑powered environmental monitor with a three‑year coin‑cell battery. It provides high‑precision temperature readings and stores up to 54 000 historical records, enabling detailed environmental audits.</li>
            <li><strong>TK418/TK319L Vehicle Tracker Series</strong> – Integrates Cat‑M1 and NB‑IoT dual connectivity with Bluetooth 5.0 for comprehensive fleet management, over‑the‑air firmware updates and 5‑year battery life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each solution is built with Apple Ko’s philosophy in mind: delivering dependable, energy‑efficient devices that empower customers to manage assets seamlessly across the globe.</p>

        <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
        <p>As 2G and 3G networks sunset, adopting LTE‑M and NB‑IoT isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s a strategic step toward resilient supply chains. The growing IoT ecosystem allows companies of all sizes to track more assets, integrate data directly into enterprise systems and leverage predictive analytics for smarter decisions.</p>
        <p>At EELink, we’re committed to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with IoT tracking, from ultra‑long‑standby devices to multi‑sensor platforms. And as we continue to innovate, Apple Ko looks forward to helping businesses navigate this transformation—building supply chains that are not only <strong>visible</strong> but also <strong>intelligent</strong> and <strong>efficient</strong>.</p>
